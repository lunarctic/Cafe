TO DO
-need to edit the fridge bc the top is too big compared to the rest of the kitchen
-check why there is a gap between feet and furniture
    -on the left side of the counter there is a bigger gap for some reason
    update: i tried fixing it and now the char doesnt move at all

IDEAS
-go shopping for food (i dont think i have time for this)
-get new recipes (timer, API question?)
-high score (money or how many dishes u served)
-display fact on a board (fact of the day? hour?)
