        <h2>How To Play</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you don't know what to do, come back to this page to reread this guide. Your progress will be saved.</li>
            <li>Move around with the W, A, S, D keys</li>
            <li>You can change your character skin by clicking on the "Character Customisation" button on the right</li>
            <li>On the upper left corner of your screen you will get an order. Your mission is to make the order and deliver it</li>
            <li>First, check out the recipes by clicking on the "Open Recipe Book" button on the left</li>
            <li>Once you know what ingredients you need, get them from the fridge. Clicking on an item will copy it to your inventory. Clicking on an item that is already in your inventory will get rid of it and you can reselect a different item </li>
            <li>After you have all your ingredients, put them in the oven on the far left of the kitchen. Clicking on an item in your inventory will transfer it to an oven slot and clicking on an item in the oven will transfer it back to your inventory. The order of the ingredients doesn't matter.</li>
            <li>Click on the "Bake" button to... well, bake your ingredients :D </li>
            <li>Once the timer is up, take the finished dessert out of the oven by clicking on it (and it will transfer to your inventory)</li>
            <li>Now all that's left is to walk up to that plate in the middle of the counter, place the order on the plate and deliver it.</li>
            <li>Getting the order right will give you XP and a new recipe unlocks at every level. On the other hand, messing up an order will result in XP loss... So be warned! We take our orders very seriously at this cafe.</li>
            <li>Alright, that's about it. Now get to work already! There's tons of customers waiting for you :D </li>
        </ul>
